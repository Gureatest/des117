    <h2>Coloniality of Gender and Conforming to the Binary</h2>

<section id="introduction">
    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p>The coloniality of gender rests in the idea that the gender system and gender binary root
        from colonial ideas that allowed the cis heterosexual white man to place individuals in a social
        hierarchy, but more important all under the cis heterosexual white man. For example, in
        analyzing West African cultural understanding of gender, the concepts that stretch beyond what
        we know as a binary will still fit under the colonial gender binary. “Gender as introduced by the
        West as a tool of domination that designates two binarily opposed and hierarchical social
        categories. Women (the gender term) is not defined through biology, though it is assigned to
        anafemales. Women are defined in relation to men, the norm” (Lugones 8). The idea of
        colonizers stretching cultural perceptions of the individual and fitting them into binary lays in the
        roots of colonialism and putting the white man in power. Post-colonized Yoruba society under a
        gender binary was heavily dominated by men, as the categorization of women meant that they
        could no longer hold leadership positions. Yoruba power structures, before colonization, were
        not gender determined.</p>

<section id="coloniality">
    <h3>The Coloniality of Gender</h3>         

    <p>The colonial gender system was built to separate the world into light and dark. “A
        conception of humanity was consolidated according to which the world's population was
        differentiated in two groups: superior and inferior, rational and irrational, primitive and civilized,
        traditional and modern” (Lugones 4). In the modern colonial gender system, these two groups
        would be separated into what we know today as male and female. However, the coloniality of gender also lays
        roots in the racialization of gender. The concept of light and dark in the colonial
        conception of humanity applies to race as much as it does to gender, which results in a heavy
        correlation between the two identities. The basis of gender lies heavily in physical attributes,
        whether body structure or genitalia, all of which fail to include racial differences in physical
        features, thus creating the racialization of gender. This causes prejudice against women and men
        of color, with women of color being seen as more aggressive due to lacking the features that a
        white woman would have, which was described to be as, “fragile, weak in both body and mind,
        secluded in the private, and sexually passive” (Lugones 12-13). As stated with the example in
        Yoruba, the gender binary also aims to put a single group in power, or more importantly not put
        women in power. Women of color were seen as animals who were” incapable to have a sense of
        gender, but during colonization they were categorized modified versions of “women” as it fit the
        processes of Eurocentered global capitalism” (Lugones 13). Women of color were assigned an
        inferior status of being gendered as women, but without the power and privilege that a white
        woman would have.</p>

    <h3>Intersex and the Basis of Gender</h3>

    <p>Gender is a colonial social construct, while sex is based on biology. However, both ideas
        of sex and gender are flawed due to the binary systems that hold them together. The gender
        binary is stored with outdated criteria based on physical attributes such as genitalia and body
        structures, and biological attributes such as hormones and chromosomal makeup. The binary
        division of man/woman or male/female is inherently wrong due to both evidence in the
        biological matter as well as identities that stray from the binary itself. “In the beginning of
        human existence people have given birth to babies who have had intersex traits” (Jaswal Part 3).
        Intersex people are proof of people that exist out of what the “biological” sex binary has to offer.
        The gender binary is also based on the racialization of gender, whether the stripping of gender to dehumanize
        minorities or using the gender binary to establish a social hierarchy that entirely
        benefits the cis heterosexual white man. Anyone who deviates from what is expected of what is
        man or woman is held up to higher standards than gender-conforming people. In Silvia Rivera’s
        Queens of Exile, she references how being trans comes with being visibly queer to people and its
        judgments and struggles, as well as how cis people can perform gender as they want. 
     
        <p><blockquote>“I’m tired of being labeled. I don’t even like the label transgender. I’m tired of living with labels. I just
        want to be who I am. I am Silvia Rivera. Ray Rivera left home at the age of 10 to become Silvia.
        And that’s who I am” (Rivera 71).</blockquote></p> 
      
        <p>The division of gender into a binary also leads to labeling for
        comfort to those who lay outside the binary, as expressed by Rivera. The expression of gender
        also leaves a lot to be desired for people who express themselves out of what is expected of
        people in the binary, or for people who show a desire to express themselves out of the binary.</p>
            </section>

<section id="queerness">
    <h3>Queerness in Society</h3>

    <p>Due to the roots of sex and gender lying in physical attributes and expression, gender
        non-conforming individuals are more likely to stand out and face harassment from others. Once
        again expressed by Silvia Rivera, touches on the topic of how cis individuals struggle with the
        cisnormativity and heteronormative of the gender binary chosen, particularly the example of the
        gay men in prison who flaunted a “HOMO” stamp on their signed papers, “You asked to be
        segregated. Drag queens didn’t have to ask for it. We were automatically segregated” (Rivera
        76). As a trans feminine presenting individual, Rivera’s perspective on labels and the interaction
        of cis individuals with the gender binary versus the interaction of trans individuals with the
        gender binary is an interesting conversation. From observation of both cis and trans spaces, there
        is a heavy emphasis on the concept of passing, and an emphasis on the trans label. In a society
        based around the gender binary, being trans —whether within or outside the binary, such as nonbinary
        individuals —puts an individual standing out and facing harassment or violence as a result, especially from
        those who feel the need to enforce the gender binary. This, as a result,
        put’s a lot of stress on passing and assimilating into the gender binary, which results in a demand
        for gender-affirming resources. However, to enforce the gender binary, trans individuals are
        often barred from receiving these resources leaving them stranded in a cisnormative society. In a
        society where looking cis is seen as expected, it feels impossible to seem normal under a gender
        binary. Perhaps in a world with the gender binary deconstructed, there would not be such a need
        to pass, and gender-affirming healthcare would seem more like a stern choice than a necessity to
        live.</p>

<section id="conclusion">
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>

    <p>Decolonizing and eliminating the gender binary frees the racialization of gender and the
        oppression of those outside of the expectations of the binary. The liberation of gender is the
        liberation of gender expression and sexuality. The decolonization of gender breaks down the
        oppressive systems in society even just a little and breaks down the social hierarchy that
        prioritizes and benefits the cis heterosexual white man. Breaking the gender binary breaks down
        cisnormativity, heteronormativity, and gender biases according to race. However, the gender
        binary is heavily engrained in the systems of society, and many people find comfort in the
        expectations held by the gender binary. Gender upholds systems that hold society together, albeit
        by flawed ties. The medical field, legal system, societal expectations, and gender roles are all
        upheld by the gender and sex binary. Deconstruction of the binaries would require reconstruction
        of all these systems, which is undesirable to people in power.</p>
