            <p>A subject that caught my particularly was the section on box shadows, and other general border elements.
                For example,
                the section on picture-perfect borders was interesting to me, especially as a concept and a tool more
                than actual
                function. I've had many experiences experimenting with border radius, drop shadows, and borders in
                general. I believe that border properties can essentially make or break a design, both aesthetically and
                in functionality.</p>

            <p>However, as a function, border radius and box-shadow/text-shadow rules are especially important nowadays
                due to how much
                functionality they add to making a design more modern. Considering how much I use these elements in my
                own design, it is
                important to stress how useful these attributes are. Shadows on objects allow for basic layering and aid
                in legibility
                greatly, especially under text. Border radius and other border allows the creation of the different
                aesthetics of modern
                websites, particularly the rounded corners and cards. For example, this blog uses many instances of
                these elements to
                achieve that modern aesthetic!</p>
