            <p>By definition, Web 2.0 is quite literally the second stage of development of the internet. Coined by
                Darcy DiNucci in
                1999, it signified the transition from boring static web pages to more dynamic pages with user-generated
                content. This
                also meant the first rise of social media and the internet being used for person-to-person
                communication.

            <p>There is no definite definition for Web 2.0, and there is no strict start and end date for it either. Web
                2.0, while
                having a visual impact was also a shift in the philosophy of web companies and developers. Whereas the
                internet was
                first used as a tool, it started to become a part of who we are instead. The web became a platform
                rather than just a
                network.</p>

            <p>Web 2.0 allowed people to operate on real-time servers and communicate with others while posting their
                own content
                thanks to the help of the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP). The introduction of application
                programming interfaces
                (API) allowed web developers to do more with their websites and communicate with their users and the
                applications.
                Technology that had arisen from this change in philosophy are JavaScript, Adobe Flash (rip), MS
                Silverlight, Eclipse,
                and Ajax.</p>

            <p>Web 2.0 was able to garner more users of the internet, thanks to such technologies as Ajax which allowed
                websites to
                communicate with the browser automatically. Improvements to the usability of websites meant that more
                people would be
                willing to use them. This allowed the transition of the internet into the social web, focusing on the
                human interaction
                aspect of websites rather than a tool.</p>
