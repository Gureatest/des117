    <p>My cat, otherwise known as <b>Mimi</b> (coined by my mom), is a stray cat from my mom’s work in Tracy. We know nothing about
    her, but she is a black cat that is estimated to be a year to a year and a half in age. She is a destructive cat who is
    shy around strangers, but most of her behavior comes from the fact that she was a stray (a stowaway, if you will).</p>
