            <h2>god forbid 2 of 'em</h2>

            <time class="articledate" datetime="2023-08-02 16:43">august 2nd, 2023</time>

            <p>It’s so interesting to see how much of the trans elder groups are primarily just, white people. In fact,
                everyone except
                me and my girlfriend was white. It made me wonder; how much space white trans people take up in the
                general trans space
                to begin with. I had originally thought it was primarily an online space issue, but clearly that has a
                little bit of
                truth in real life. </p>

            <p>I also wondered about how much representation white trans people (let’s face it white people in general)
                get in the
                media. It’s even more interesting to see how much coverage, positive or negative, that white trans
                people get in
                general. White trans people get their ‘first evers’ while trans people of color are left trying to
                figure out what they
                should relate to more; a cis person of color in media or a white trans person. The trick answer is that
                they don’t
                relate to either of them.</p>

            <img src="images/post3.jpg" alt="woman crying scrapbook">

            <p>I have seen how us trans people of color are forced to confront our identities constantly, and yet we
                continue to get
                pushed out of white trans spaces due to our inability to increase our proximity to whiteness. I feel
                that
                intersectionality is something that people just can’t seem to comprehend, despite being a simple concept
                in truth. Majority of people have intersectional identities, whether they choose to see that or not.
                Intersectionality is understanding the privileges and disadvantages you have as a result of the crossing
                of identities. Perhaps that’s just a case of people who don’t end up confronting multiple identities of
                themselves at once, since
                enduring is a part of understanding.</p>
