            <p>Something trans people of color end up dealing with is the cross between their culture and family and their own
            inevitable happiness with themselves and their bodies. It is common for immigrant trans families to be less accepting,
            whether because of religion, ancestral colonization, or what have you. A common thing that people tend to say is to just
            cut off your family, or just be independent. In a sense, it makes a lot of sense, and I see myself taking action to do
            this as well. However, how is it fair? How is it fair that other people get to live their two lives together while we
            must decide which one will let us live the longest?</p>

            <p>Without family is a large disconnect from culture, particularly for mine as a Chinese person. I’m sure other ethnicities
            can relate greatly and playing the strange game of balance to keep both family and your own identity without losing
            either of them completely. It involves managing yourself around different environments, and at some points it feels like
            two entirely different people.</p>
    
            <p>In the case of white trans people, it’s easier to brush off family since there is no attachment to traditions, and
            claiming radical queerness makes them ‘more oppressed’ in the ‘oppression Olympics.’ I am only partially serious, but it
            is obvious to see based on how quickly white trans people choose to disconnect from their families. Trans people of
            color’s one solitude from a white-centric world (particularly in the United States) are with family, and once that is
            gone, forcefully or not, you find yourself in queer spaces that are just as white-centric, and suddenly you’re found
            stuck in limbo.</p>
