            <h2>the borderland</h2>
    
            <time class="articledate" datetime="2023-08-03">august 3rd, 2023</time>
    
            <p>When researching for a paper in gender studies, I came across a study that delves into how people (particularly Latino
            trans-masculine people) were perceived when they transitioned. In a specific instance, many of them were viewed as less
            white upon transitioning. Diego, a Puerto Rican 24-year-old queer trans man, said that pre-transition he was viewed as a
            white woman, both in census data and in public as white-passing.</p>
    
            <p>However, post-transition he was seen as Latino and states that his ethnicity was easier to read. It explains the way
            people of color sit outside the gender binary, both because of the racialization of their presented gender and the
            invalidity of their queer status in predominately white queer spaces as people of color. As a Chinese trans-femme, there
            are a lot of presumptions both as an Asian man pre-transition and as an Asian woman post-transition. Asian women fall
            victim to the orientalism that we’ve seen throughout history.</p>

            <p>Yet, I feel as though my transition was made easier because of how Asian men are viewed as more feminine, thus making my
            transition into femininity more “natural” per say for other people. My girlfriend does not agree, and suggests that it
            makes it harder as others would question you as to just settle as a feminine Asian man.</p>
    
            <p>It’s interesting to witness, as I feel that the concept of “occupying the borderland”, also researched in writing the
            paper, is represented very well through these experiences. It represents the dual consciousness of race and gender and
            embraces the ambiguity and fluidity of identity, and I feel that many transgender people of color occupy and sympathizes
            with.</p>
