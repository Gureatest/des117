        <h2>queer to me</h2>

            <time class="articledate" datetime="2023-08-04">august 4th, 2023</time>

            <p>As a queer trans person, being queer and being trans are simultaneously deeply intertwined with each other, but also
            live in separate worlds, especially within my life. Queer refers to how I belong in a diverse community of experiences
            and lives. How we aren’t seen as “typical” of society, therefore deemed “queer”. Queer is about how we all experience a
            form of exclusion from society for being who we are, or to who and how we want to love. </p>
            
            <p>Queer means when I see another
            queer person when I’m out and about, there’s this connection made based on our existence in society as queer people:
            even if we don’t end up exchanging looks or words. The term queer refers to the sheer joy when I see queer people
            expressing joy. Queer also refers to the pain that we feel, whether from our family, from politicians, or just passing
            conversation.</p>

            <p>Being trans is something I hold dearly, as painful as it can be, even beyond being queer. Trans refers to the way we see
            our own bodies so differently. It refers to the way our bodies are different, and there’s so much beauty in that. Trans
            refers to the joy that we experience, whether from gender euphoria, or from loved ones.</p>
            
            <p>But it also refers to the devastating parts: the dysphoria, the fight for our own increasingly disappearing rights, and the anxiety of existing as
            trans. Being trans is seeing so many ways people present themselves, both in and outside the binary. It’s seeing how
            others are confident in their skin, and how others remain hidden. Trans refers to the unique experience that is beyond
            being queer.</p>
