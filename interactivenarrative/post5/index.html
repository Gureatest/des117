            <p>As a queer trans person, being queer and being trans are simultaneously deeply intertwined with each other,
                but also
                live in separate worlds, especially within my life. Queer refers to how I belong in a diverse community of
                experiences
                and lives. How we aren’t seen as “typical” of society, therefore deemed “queer”. Queer is about how we all
                experience a
                form of exclusion from society for being who we are, or to who and how we want to love. </p>
    
            <p>Queer means when I see another
                queer person when I’m out and about, there’s this connection made based on our existence in society as queer
                people:
                even if we don’t end up exchanging looks or words. The term queer refers to the sheer joy when I see queer
                people
                expressing joy. Queer also refers to the pain that we feel, whether from our family, from politicians, or
                just passing
                conversation.</p>

            <p>Being trans is something I hold dearly, as painful as it can be, even beyond being queer. Trans refers to the
                way we see
                our own bodies so differently. It refers to the way our bodies are different, and there’s so much beauty in
                that. Trans
                refers to the joy that we experience, whether from gender euphoria, or from loved ones.</p>
    
            <p>But it also refers to the devastating parts: the dysphoria, the fight for our own increasingly disappearing
                rights, and the anxiety of existing as
                trans. Being trans is seeing so many ways people present themselves, both in and outside the binary. It’s
                seeing how
                others are confident in their skin, and how others remain hidden. Trans refers to the unique experience that
                is beyond
                being queer.</p>
